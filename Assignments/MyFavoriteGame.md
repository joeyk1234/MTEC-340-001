My favorite game is Hollow Knight, largely because of the way exploration works in the game. Hollow Knight is a *Metroidvania*, which is a genre that stems from the games *Metroid* and *Castlevania*. These games tend to have very similar ways to progress in the world, with the player collecting upgrades for traversal which unlock new parts of the map. Hollow Knight was the first metroidvania I played, and is one of the main reasons I remained interested in videogames as an adult. The progression in this game is paced very well, and each of the areas in the map is rewarding to explore and come back to later with more upgrades.
